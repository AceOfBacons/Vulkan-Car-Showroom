# Vulkan-Car-Showroom
Car showroom build using custom Vulkan SDK engine. The engine was build from scratch taking advantage of Vulkan libraries and features specular and diffuse lightning.
It also supports importing of obj type models and multiple point lights.
Furthermore, personalized camera and input controls were made to navigate, modify the rotation of vehicles and change the lightning color (which is randomly generated on execution).

Instructions:
Open the week5 sln, and then the tutorial 24 project (since this was done in multiple workspaces). and execute.
